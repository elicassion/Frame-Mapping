In the example above, the word it is grammatically the Object of the target verb expect, but it does not express an FE. Rather, it is merely construed as the External Argument of the verb rain, which heads the VP Complement of the target. In this situation, both the raised consituent it and the VP Complement are marked with the Phenomenon FE, but are marked as separate constituents. That is because the Object can be passivized and therefore not appear adjacent to the VP Complement: It is expected to rain. "
